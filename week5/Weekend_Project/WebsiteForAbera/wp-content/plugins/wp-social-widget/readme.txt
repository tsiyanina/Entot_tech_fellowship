A widget to add links of social networking sites. 

== Description ==

WP Social Widget is a plugin which takes a simple, extendable approach to display links along with social icons to your social networking  profiles in WordPress

You will find following widget with options:

* Background Color
* Background Hover Color
* Icon Color
* Icon Hover Color
* Icon to circle
* Input fields to input your social profile links

From ver 2.0.0, we also have added shortcode feature . You can use shortcode => `[wpsw]` to produce the social icons.
Before that you need to assign social link in the shortcode. 
For example `[wpsw background_color = "#ffffff" facebook="your_profile_url"]`
= Here are the parameters of the shortcode given below =

* target                  [default: _blank options: same as `<a>` tag's target attribute  ]
